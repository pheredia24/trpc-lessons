I see that each lesson has this message:

ðŸ“š Lesson Content

This lesson covers queries - reading data. The content would be dynamically loaded from the markdown files in src/lessons/queries.md.

In a complete implementation, we would parse the markdown files and render the content here. For now, try the interactive playground below to explore the tRPC procedures!

Can we make sure that the lessons are fully ready?

Add a description of how we are using tRPC ourselves for the lessons web app

Show how the code would be if we were using REST
